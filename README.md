# hello-world

Hello everyone!

Kenia here, I'm always up for a new challenge. I've learned that taking a risks is part of life challenging you. 
The universe works in mysterious ways. I recently got my bachelor's degree in Science In Information Systems with a concentration in Software Engineering. Everyday I keep learning something new in the coding world. I plan to continue 
learning and growing so one day my goal of becoming a professional software engineer.
